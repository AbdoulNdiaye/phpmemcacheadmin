== 1. Download ==

== 2. Edit /config/config.ini ==

  * Under section *api*
  There are 5 configuration for api section
    * *stats* : Server stats
    * *slabs* : Server slabs
    * *items* : Slabs items
    * *get* : Get an item from a key
    * *delete* : Delete an item
  You can use Server, Memcache or Memcached for each one

  Stats from PECL Memcached are very light, so i recommand you not to use it

  PECL Memcached does not support slabs and items command

  PECL Memcached can only reads it's own data

  PECL Memcache can reads some of PECL Memcached items


  * Under section *servers*
  Add your servers from template server[] = server_name:port

  example :

  server[] = localhost:11211

  server[] = server_two:11211

  server[] = server_three:11211


  * Under section *connection*
  You can modify connection timeout to each server


  * Under section *items*
  Max items dump for slabs item dump, don't put a too high value

  * Under section *date*
  Only to correct a E_STRICT, no use actually
